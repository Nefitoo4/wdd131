        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
          7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
          and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
          Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.

        <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
        <p>
          27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I
          give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is
          sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they
          humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make
          weak things become strong unto them.
